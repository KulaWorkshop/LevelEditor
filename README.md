## Windows 7

This program requires **WebView2**, a commonly used Microsoft runtime that allows web interfaces to be built into desktop applications. This **should** be already installed, notably on Windows versions **10 and 11**, but some versions of Windows do not have it installed. If you are getting an error when launching the program, you may not have this dependency installed. To install it, simply download it from Microsoft's website [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section).

-   Click the download button under the **Bootstrapper** section.
-   Run through the installer instructions.
